<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->


**Purpose**
: Introduce different summary tables under group stratification

**Description**
: The SAS file walks through data analysis for a demonstration dataset using three SAS macros: %DSTMAC [@Fenchel2011], %UNI_CAT [@Liu2019], and %ggBaseline [@Gu2018]. Two variables ("trt" and "sex") are used as stratification variables. In summary statistics, means Â± standard deviations are calculated for continuous variables and N (%) are produced for categorical variables. Statistical tests include:

* Parametric Test: T-Test/ANOVA for continuous variables
* Parametric Test: Likelihood Ratio Chi-Square Test for categorical variables
* Non-parametric Test: Kruskal-Wallis Test for continuous variables 
* Non-parametric Test: Fisher's Exact Test for categorical variables

**Dataset**
: PBC 

**Date**
: 09/24/2019 

**Demonstrated SAS Version**
: SAS 9.4
